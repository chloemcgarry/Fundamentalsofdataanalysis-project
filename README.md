# Fundamentalsofdataanalysis-project

This repository is a submission for the module "Fundamentals of Data Analysis" in GMIT for the H.Dip in Data Analytics.
Module code: 52446



Project instructions given by Dr. Ian McLoughlin:

"This assessment concerns the well-known tips [6] dataset and the Python [1] packages seaborn [5] and jupyter [4]. The project is worth 100% of your marks for this module, but it is broken into three parts, as follows. 


(30%) Description: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a jupyter [4] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips [6] dataset. This part is worth 30% of your overall mark. 


(30%) Regression: To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount, and this part is also worth 30%.


(40%) Analyse: Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish â€” for example, you may analyse all pairs of variables, or select a subset and analyse those. This part is worth 40%."



This project is completed as the main assessment for the Fundamentals of Data Analytics Module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.


This submission contains a README.md file which contains the purpose of this repository, the outline of the project and intructions to follow to access the repository. It also contains a juypter notebook which contains code, results and analysis as required by the project guidelines.
